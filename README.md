Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness... a wedding website?! 👰🏻🥂🤵🏻

Here is the wedding website I made recently - this is a demo version with all personal details removed and names changed! The email form has also been disconnected for this live version

Here are a few things the couple wanted for their site:
- "Nothing boring or cliche, we want something which reflects us"
- "We love record shops and music and books and 70's design"
- "Some sort of RSVP form so we don't have to spend ages sifting through notebooks and documents"

This site was a lot of fun to make and taught me a few things along the way. Diving into the CSS side of things was great, as was getting to grips with the email form. Overall, win-win!
